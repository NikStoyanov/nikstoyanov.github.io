  <p class="font-125">This blog is build with hugo on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. 
  It also has a daily CRON job on <a href="https://travis-ci.org/NikStoyanov/nikstoyanov.github.io">Travis-CI</a>
  which runs an <a href="https://github.com/NikStoyanov/nikstoyanov.github.io/blob/master/Rakefile">update script</a> to pull new running and swimming activities. Gym and random entries are manual since they can be unique and that prevents automation. The idea and majority of code is from <a href="https://code.dblock.org/2018/02/17/auto-publishing-strava-runs-to-github-pages.html">Daniel Doubrovkine</a>.
  The rest has been adapted to suit my purposes and you can fork the code <a href="https://github.com/NikStoyanov/nikstoyanov.github.io">on github</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/dblock/strava-ruby-client">Ruby Strava API client</a> is used to pull new activities and post process them to markdown blogposts.</p>
